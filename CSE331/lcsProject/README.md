Longest Common Subsequence

Author: Daniel Thompson

TO COMPILE: g++ lcs.cpp -o LCS !!OR!! make

TO RUN: ./LCS <file1> <file2>

This program was practice in finding the longest common subsequence between two strings of numbers.

The program outputs the longest common subsequence between the two files.

There are two sets of testing files, test# and inputfile#. The test# is a very short input whereas the inputfile# is longer.
