TO COMPILE:
g++ bfs.cpp -o BFS
!!OR!!
make 

TO RUN:
./BFS <graph file> <starting node>

This program was practice in using the Breadth-First Search method with a graph.
The graph file is set up as such:
*Number of nodes in graph
*Each line after is the relation of each node

The program outputs the end state list after the search, the parent node of wach node, and the distance to each node.
