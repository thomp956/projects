Build Heap Project

Author: Daniel Thompson

TO COMPILE: g++ build_heap.cpp -o build_heap

TO RUN: ./build_heap

This program was to help practice my use of the heapify algorithm and creating a heap out of an array.

The program asks for how many elements you want in an array, generates an array of that length with random numbers, and creates a heap out of that array.
