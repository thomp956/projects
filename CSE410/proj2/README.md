PThread Project

Author: Daniel Thompson

TO COMPILE: make

TO RUN: ./proj2 <inputfile> <outputfile <keyword> <minsizeForSorting> <attribute#>

This program was practice using pthreads in C++. The program takes an input file, reads the file with one thread, sorts it with another, and writes the sorted data with a third.
